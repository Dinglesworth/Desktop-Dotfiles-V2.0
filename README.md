# Desktop Dotfiles V2.0
This is an updated version of the configs for BSPWM on my desktop computer this is the sister repo of the laptop based one as due to the differences in screen size etc they share different configs and I find it easiest to manage them semi seperately. In this repo there will be all of the dotfiles for my system as well as a package list for easy reinstallation and the AUR package list for easy regathering of all of my AUR packages.

As well as the files unique to my home directory there will also be the changes that I made to the actual root file system such as lightdm themes and such.
